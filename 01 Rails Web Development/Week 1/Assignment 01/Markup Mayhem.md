# Markdown Greeting

Hey Charlie,

## Here's some markdown fu fo you.

*that's italictastic*

**I'm getting a little bold**

Sorry to make you read that :grimacing:

(_what!?! Emojis don't show in Bloc's message system?!? __sad__ _ )


## Goal Uno

For one of my first projects,
I want to revamp my portfolio website.
The current version resides [here](http://www.glenngartner.com).

Some things I'd like to change:
1. Host the content on a server myself (ditch Blogger)
2. Make an intelligent image layout system (I can explain more later)
3. Add an interactive element with 3D models and [three.js](http://threejs.org/)
4. Change all of the front end work
5. Design friendly customization tools for front end tweaking

Here's are a couple screenshots from the last game I created:

## What's that? You want a generic unordered list?
### Sure, you've got it.  

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 3
  * Item 4
    * Item 5
    * Item n
    * This is so much fun
      * I'll continue this forev....
      * Nope

## While I'm at it, I throw a solid quote your way:

> Success comes from knowing what you don't know, more than coming from what you do know.
> - Ray Dalio

## Some naughty scripts, too

```javascript
// This would probably get me in trouble, wouldn't it?
i = 1
while (i=1)
    {
        console.log("Get me outta here!");
    }
```

### Tasks for the week
I have a few items to check off before I'm finished with *this* **assignment**.

You know, I'll just make a list, and check it twice (_sorry, that was terrible too_):
- [x] Upload a photo of myself to my Bloc account
- [x] Complete my account and bio for Bloc
- [x] Send a message to you in .md format / syntax
- [ ] Find you on Slack, and send another message
- [ ] Write a list of goals for us to discuss at our next meeting

# That'll
### do it
